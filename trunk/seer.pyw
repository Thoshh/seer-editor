#   To Run:
#
#   Windows Users:  Make sure ".pyw" files are associated with the pythonw.exe file in your python-directory.
#
#   Linux/Unix Users:  Make sure the first line of this file is the correct path to python:
#   "/bin/python", "/usr/bin/python", "/usr/local/bin/python" are all suggestions.
#   Using "/bin/env python" should find it for you though.
